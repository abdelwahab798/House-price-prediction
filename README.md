# House Price Prediction 🏡📊  

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict house prices based on various features such as **location, number of rooms, square footage, and other factors**. The goal is to build an accurate regression model to estimate housing prices and help in real estate decision-making.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Linear Regression, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation)  
- **Data Preprocessing** (Handling Missing Values, Outliers, and Feature Scaling)  
- **Visualization** (Heatmaps, Distribution Plots, Correlation Analysis)  

## 🔥 Project Highlights  
✅ Collected and cleaned real-world housing data  
✅ Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key factors affecting house prices  
✅ Built and optimized a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices  
✅ Evaluated model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score**
